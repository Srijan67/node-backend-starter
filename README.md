# node-backend-starter

This is a updated version of the previous repo in my github repository with name node-starter.
Unlike the previous repo, this repo contains multiple awesome features require to build a industrial level application like paginations(with n number of data in a single page
define by developer by default it is 10). Searching feature with regexFilter array to implement on any field, sorting and filtering as well.
Also it has state of the art Date Range Filter. Thanks to it's all in one TableFilterQuery library.
